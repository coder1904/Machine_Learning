# Regression Analysis
The aim of this project was to extract a set of tweets from multiple twitter users and perform various tasks such as data pre-processing, 
explatory data analysis and regression analysis to investigate the relatinship of different variables. Tweepy was used to extract the tweets.

# Disease Prediction
This project constructed multiple machine learning classifiers to diagnose diabetes based on patient symptoms. A range of classifiers were evaluated 
and a plethora of fine tuning methods were utilised (such as minority oversampling, feature selection/extraction) to maximise their performance.
